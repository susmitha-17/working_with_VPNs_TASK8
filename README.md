setup and usage of ProtonVPN to understand how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) protect online privacy and ensure secure communication.      

This task focuses on understanding the concept and practical application of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) as a key privacy and security tool in cybersecurity. A VPN encrypts user data and routes internet traffic through a secure tunnel, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and ensuring private communication over public networks.        

The task involved selecting a free and reliable VPN client (ProtonVPN), performing the installation and setup process, connecting to different VPN servers, and verifying changes in IP address and network behavior. Additionally, it included analyzing how VPN encryption safeguards user data and identifying both the benefits and limitations of VPN technology.          

Through this exercise, I developed hands-on experience in configuring VPNs, understanding tunneling protocols, encryption mechanisms, and privacy preservation techniques, which are essential skills for anyone pursuing a career in network security or cybersecurity.
